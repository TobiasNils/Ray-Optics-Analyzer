# Ray-optics Analyzer

Integration of ray-optics simulations for optical systems design in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
The raytracing algorithms implemented here are adaptations of the [pyOpTools](https://github.com/cihologramas/pyoptools) v0.1.1 code-base.

>## pyOpTools

>pyOpTools is a set of packages that allow the simulation of optical systems by raytracing as well as some calculations involving wavefronts, currently under development. It is written in Python and Cython, and is being developed by the technological development group of [CombustiÃ³n Ingenieros S.A.S](http://www.cihologramas.com), and the applied optics group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

>The pyOpTools is divided in several packages that contain the different library's functionalities:

>    pyoptools.raytrace

>This package contains the classes and functions used to perform the simulation of optical systems using 3D non-sequential raytracing algorithms.

>    pyoptools.misc

>This package contains miscellaneous classes and functions used by the other packages, but that can not be classified in any of them.
