General Description
===================

The pyOpTools are a set of packages that allow
the simulation of optical systems. Initially it was developed in 
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ using `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and 
`Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_, but the computational intensive parts
are now written in `Cython <http://www.cython.org>`_ to optimize for
speed. It also uses `wxpython <http://wxpython.org>`_, 
`matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_ and `pyopengl <http://www.pyopengl.org>`_
for the graphic environment.
